We specialize in energy-efficient lighting systems.\nCustomer: Okay, I've heard of you. What can you do for me?\nAgent: We've recently launched a new line of LED bulbs that can help reduce your energy consumption by up to 50%.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. I've been looking to cut down on my energy bills.\nAgent: Exactly. Our bulbs are not only energy-efficient but also last up to 5 times longer than traditional bulbs.\nCustomer: How much do they cost?\nAgent: We're currently offering a promotional discount of 10% off our usual price of $20 per bulb.\nCustomer: That's still a bit pricey for me. What kind of warranty do you offer?\nAgent: We offer a 5-year warranty on all our bulbs, and we also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nCustomer: Okay, I'm interested. How many bulbs would I need for my office?\nAgent: Can you tell me a bit more about your office space? How many rooms do you have?\nCustomer: It's a small office with 5 rooms.\nAgent: Based on that, I would recommend at least 10-15 bulbs.\nCustomer: Alright, I'll take 12 bulbs. What's the total cost?\nAgent: With the discount, that would come out to be $216.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds good. How do I place the order?\nAgent: I can take your order right now over the phone. Would you like to pay by credit card or check?\nCustomer: I'll pay by credit card. Go ahead and take my payment information.\nAgent: Great, thank you, Mr. Johnson. Your order will be shipped out within the next 24 hours."
