  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system offers real-time monitoring, motion detection, and alerts sent directly to your phone.\nCustomer: That sounds great. I've had some issues with break-ins in my neighborhood lately.\nAgent: I understand your concern. Our system has a 99% success rate in preventing burglaries.\nCustomer: That's impressive. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The initial installation fee is $500, and then it's $30 per month for monitoring.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Do you have any promotions?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a special right now. If you sign up within the next week, we'll waive the installation fee.\nCustomer: That sounds like a good deal. What's the process for installation?\nAgent: One of our technicians will come to your home and set up the system. It usually takes about 2 hours.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you email me the details?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send you a follow-up email with all the information.\nCustomer: Great, thank you. I look forward to reviewing it.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll also include a free consultation to ensure the system meets your specific needs.\nCustomer: That sounds good. I'll talk to you soon, John.\nAgent: Sounds great. Have a good day, and I look forward to hearing back from you."
