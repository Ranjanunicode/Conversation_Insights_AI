  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new energy-efficient water heater.\nCustomer: Oh, hi John. I've been looking into replacing my old water heater, so this is good timing.\nAgent: Great to hear that. Our product is top-of-the-line, with a 10-year warranty and significant savings on your energy bill.\nCustomer: That sounds good. What kind of savings are we talking about?\nAgent: On average, our customers see a 20-30% reduction in their energy costs.\nCustomer: That's impressive. What's the price point for this water heater?\nAgent: We're currently running a promotion for $1,200, which is a $300 discount from the regular price.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Do you offer any financing options?\nAgent: Yes, we do. We have a 0% interest financing plan for 12 months.\nCustomer: That sounds like it could work. What's the installation process like?\nAgent: We handle the installation, and it usually takes about 2-3 hours. We'll also remove your old water heater at no extra cost.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you send me some more information and schedule an installation?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send you an email with the details, and we can schedule the installation for this week or next.\nCustomer: This week would be great, if possible.\nAgent: I'll check the schedule and get back to you within the hour to confirm.\nCustomer: Sounds good, thank you.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll talk soon."
