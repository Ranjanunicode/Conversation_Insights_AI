What makes yours different?\nAgent: Our thermostat learns your schedule and preferences to optimize heating and cooling, saving you up to 30% on your energy bill.\nCustomer: That sounds great. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The thermostat itself is $250, and we also offer installation services starting at $100.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit higher than I expected. Do you have any promotions or discounts?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a special offer right now. If you purchase the thermostat and installation within the next week, we'll give you 10% off the total price.\nCustomer: That helps. Can you tell me more about the installation process?\nAgent: Our certified technicians will schedule a time that works for you and complete the installation in about an hour.\nCustomer: Alright, I'm interested. Can you send me some more information and a quote?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send you an email with all the details.
