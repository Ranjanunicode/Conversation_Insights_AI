We specialize in energy-efficient products for homes and businesses.\nCustomer: Okay, what can you do for me?\nAgent: We've recently launched a new line of smart thermostats that can help you save up to 30% on your energy bills.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. I've been looking for ways to reduce my energy costs.\nAgent: Great! Our thermostats are Wi-Fi enabled, allowing you to control the temperature remotely through your smartphone or tablet.\nCustomer: That's convenient. How much do they cost?\nAgent: Our starter package begins at $199, which includes the thermostat and installation.\nCustomer: That's a bit higher than I was expecting. Do you have any discounts available?\nAgent: We're currently offering a 10% discount for first-time customers. Would you like me to apply that to the price?\nCustomer: Yes, please. So, that would bring it down to $179?\nAgent: Exactly. And we also offer a 5-year warranty on all our products.\nCustomer: Okay, I think I'm interested. Can you schedule an installation for this week?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) Yes, we have an opening on Thursday. Would that work for you?\nCustomer: Yes, that's perfect. Thank you, Emily.\nAgent: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. I'll send you a confirmation email with all the details.\nCustomer: Sounds good. Thank you again.\nAgent: You're welcome. Have a great day!"
