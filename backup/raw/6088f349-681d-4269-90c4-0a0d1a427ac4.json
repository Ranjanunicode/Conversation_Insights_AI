Who is this and what's GreenTech?\nAgent: We specialize in energy-efficient solutions for homes and businesses. I'm calling about our new smart thermostat.\nCustomer: Oh, I've been looking into those. What makes yours different?\nAgent: Our thermostat learns your schedule and preferences to optimize heating and cooling, saving you up to 30% on your energy bill.\nCustomer: That sounds impressive. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The thermostat itself is $250, and we offer installation services starting at $100.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit higher than I expected. Do you have any promotions or discounts?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a special right now. If you purchase the thermostat and installation together, we'll give you 10% off the total price.\nCustomer: That helps. Can you tell me more about the installation process?\nAgent: Our certified technicians will install the thermostat and ensure it's integrated with your existing system. It usually takes about an hour.\nCustomer: Alright, I'm interested. Can you schedule an installation for this weekend?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) Yes, we have an opening on Saturday morning. Would that work for you?\nCustomer: Yes, that's perfect. What's the next step?\nAgent: I'll go ahead and process your order. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details.\nCustomer: Great, thank you. I'm looking forward to it.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll see you on Saturday."
