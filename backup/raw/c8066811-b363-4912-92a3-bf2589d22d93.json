What's this about?\nAgent: We specialize in energy-efficient lighting solutions for commercial properties. I came across your company and thought our product could be a great fit.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. We've been looking to reduce our energy costs. What makes your product stand out?\nAgent: Our LED lights use up to 70% less energy than traditional lighting and have a longer lifespan, resulting in significant cost savings.\nCustomer: That's impressive. What kind of installation process are we looking at?\nAgent: Our team handles the installation, and it's usually a quick process that can be done during off-hours to minimize disruption.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds good. What's the cost of the product and installation?\nAgent: The cost varies depending on the size of your property and the number of lights needed. But on average, our customers see a return on investment within 2-3 years.\nCustomer: That's reasonable. Can you send me a quote and some more information about the product?\nAgent: Absolutely, I can send that over to you right away. Would you like me to follow up with a call next week to discuss further?\nCustomer: Yes, that would be great. Thank you for reaching out, John.\nAgent: You're welcome, and I look forward to speaking with you next week.\nCustomer: Great, have a good day.\nAgent: You too, thanks again."
