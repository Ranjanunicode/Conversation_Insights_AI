  "transcript": "Agent: Hi, my name is John and I'm calling from GreenTech. How are you today?\nCustomer: I'm doing well, thanks. Who is this and how did you get my number?\nAgent: We obtained your contact information from a trade show you attended last month. I'm calling to introduce you to our energy-efficient lighting solutions.\nCustomer: Okay, I remember attending that show. What makes your products so special?\nAgent: Our LED bulbs last up to 50% longer than competitors and use significantly less energy.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. We're actually looking to replace our current lighting system soon.\nAgent: Great timing! Our products can help you reduce your energy consumption and save on costs in the long run.\nCustomer: How much do they cost?\nAgent: Our prices start at $15 per bulb, but we're currently offering a discount for bulk orders.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit higher than what we're used to paying. What kind of support do you offer?\nAgent: We provide a 5-year warranty and dedicated customer service team to ensure a smooth transition.\nCustomer: Alright, I'd like to learn more. Can you send me some more information and a quote?\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll send you an email with all the details. Would you like to schedule a follow-up call to discuss further?\nCustomer: Yes, that would be great. How about next Wednesday?\nAgent: Sounds good. I'll make sure to schedule it. Is there anything else you'd like to know before we wrap up?\nCustomer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for the information, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. I look forward to speaking with you next Wednesday.\nCustomer: Me too, thanks.\nAgent: Have a great day and I'll talk to you soon.\nCustomer: You too, bye."
