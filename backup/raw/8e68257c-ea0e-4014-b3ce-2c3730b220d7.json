  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, my name is John and I'm calling from XYZ Corporation. How are you today?\nCustomer: I'm doing well, thanks. Who is this again?\nAgent: My name is John, and I'm calling about our new energy-efficient water heater.\nCustomer: Oh, okay. We've been thinking of replacing our old one.\nAgent: Great timing! Our water heater can save you up to 30% on your energy bill.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. How does it work?\nAgent: It uses advanced technology to heat water only when needed, reducing standby heat loss.\nCustomer: I see. And how much does it cost?\nAgent: The price starts at $1,200, but we're currently offering a $200 discount.\nCustomer: That's still a bit pricey for us. Do you have any financing options?\nAgent: Yes, we offer a 0% interest financing plan for 12 months.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds more manageable. What's the warranty on the product?\nAgent: We offer a 10-year warranty on parts and labor.\nCustomer: Alright, I think we might be interested. Can you send me some more information?\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll email you a brochure and we can schedule a follow-up call if you'd like.\nCustomer: Sounds good, thank you.\nAgent: You're welcome, have a great day!\nCustomer: You too, bye."
