  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system offers 24/7 monitoring, motion detection, and remote access through our mobile app.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. How much does it cost?\nAgent: Our basic package starts at $99 per month, with a one-time installation fee of $200.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit higher than I was expecting. Do you have any promotions?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a special right now. If you sign up within the next 48 hours, we'll waive the installation fee.\nCustomer: That helps. What kind of equipment is included?\nAgent: You'll get a control panel, three door sensors, and one motion detector.\nCustomer: Can I add more sensors later if I need to?\nAgent: Yes, you can add additional sensors at any time. We also offer outdoor cameras and other accessories.\nCustomer: Okay, I think I'm interested. What's the next step?\nAgent: I can send you a contract to review and sign. We'll also schedule an installation time that works for you.\nCustomer: Sounds good. Can you email me the contract?\nAgent: I'll send it over right away. Is there a best email address to reach you at?\nCustomer: Yeah, it's jsmith@email.com.\nAgent: Great, I'll send it to that address. We'll be in touch soon to schedule the installation.\nCustomer: Looking forward to it, thanks.\nAgent: You're welcome, have a great day!"
