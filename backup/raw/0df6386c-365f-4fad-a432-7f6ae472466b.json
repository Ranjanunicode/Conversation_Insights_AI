I've been looking to reduce my energy costs.\nAgent: Exactly. Our thermostats are Wi-Fi enabled, allowing you to control the temperature remotely through your smartphone or tablet.\nCustomer: That's convenient. How much do they cost?\nAgent: Our starter package begins at $199, which includes the thermostat and installation.\nCustomer: That's a bit more than I was expecting. Do you have any promotions or discounts available?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a special promotion this month. If you purchase the starter package, we'll throw in a free energy audit, which is a $100 value.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds like a good deal. Can you come out to my house to install it next week?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) Yes, we have an opening on Wednesday or Thursday. Which day works best for you?\nCustomer: Wednesday would be fine.\nAgent: Great, I'll go ahead and schedule the installation for Wednesday.
