  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, this is John from XYZ Corporation. How are you today?\nCustomer: I'm doing well, thanks. Who is this?\nAgent: My name is John, and I'm calling about our new energy-efficient water heater.\nCustomer: Oh, I've been looking into those. What makes yours special?\nAgent: Our water heater uses advanced technology to reduce energy consumption by up to 30%.\nCustomer: That sounds great. I'm currently paying a lot for my utility bills.\nAgent: Exactly. Our product can help you save money in the long run. We also offer a 10-year warranty.\nCustomer: That's a good warranty. What's the price point for this product?\nAgent: We're currently offering a promotion for $1,200, which is $300 off the regular price.\nCustomer: That's still a bit out of my budget. Do you have any financing options?\nAgent: Yes, we do. We offer a financing plan with 0% interest for 12 months.\nCustomer: That sounds more manageable. Can you tell me more about the installation process?\nAgent: Our installation team will take care of everything, and it usually takes about 2-3 hours.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds good. Can I get a callback to discuss this further with my husband?\nAgent: Absolutely. I can follow up with you tomorrow afternoon. Would that work for you?\nCustomer: Yes, that's fine. Thank you for the information, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Have a great day!"
