We specialize in energy-efficient appliances.\nCustomer: Okay, I'm listening. What can you offer me?\nAgent: We have a new line of smart thermostats that can help reduce your energy bills by up to 30%.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. How does it work?\nAgent: Our thermostat learns your schedule and preferences to optimize your heating and cooling system.\nCustomer: I see. And how much does it cost?\nAgent: The price starts at $250, but we're currently offering a promotion for $200.\nCustomer: That's still a bit pricey for me. Do you have any financing options?\nAgent: Yes, we do. You can pay in installments over 6 or 12 months with 0% interest.\nCustomer: Okay, that's more manageable. What kind of warranty do you offer?\nAgent: Our thermostat comes with a 5-year warranty and dedicated customer support.\nCustomer: Alright, I'm interested. Can you send me more information and a quote?\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll send you an email with all the details. Would you like me to follow up with you next week?\nCustomer: Yes, that would be great. Thanks for the information, Emily.\nAgent: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. I look forward to speaking with you soon.\nCustomer: You too, thanks again.\nAgent: Have a great day!"
