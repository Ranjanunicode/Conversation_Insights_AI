  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Oh, hi John. I did request some information about that. How does it work?\nAgent: Our system includes a central hub, door and window sensors, and a camera. It's all controlled through a mobile app.\nCustomer: That sounds great. What kind of features does the camera have?\nAgent: The camera has night vision, motion detection, and alerts you to any suspicious activity.\nCustomer: Okay, that's really what I'm looking for. How much does the system cost?\nAgent: The starter package is $499, and that includes the hub, three sensors, and one camera.\nCustomer: That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Do you have any discounts or promotions?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a special right now. If you order in the next 48 hours, we'll give you 10% off the starter package.\nCustomer: That sounds good. What kind of support do you offer if I have any issues with the system?\nAgent: We have a dedicated support team available 24/7, and we also offer a one-year warranty on all our products.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you walk me through the ordering process?\nAgent: Absolutely. I can take your order right over the phone, or I can email you a link to complete the order online.\nCustomer: Okay, just email me the link, please.\nAgent: Great, I'll send that over to you right away. Is there anything else I can answer for you?\nCustomer: No, that's all. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll get that email sent out, and we look forward to getting your new security system set up."
