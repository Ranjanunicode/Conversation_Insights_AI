  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems, but I'm not sure what I need.\nAgent: Well, our system is top-of-the-line and includes features like motion detection and live video feed.\nCustomer: That sounds good. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The basic package starts at $99 a month, but we have a promotion going on right now for $79 a month.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. What makes it worth the extra cost?\nAgent: Our system is fully integrated, so you can control it from your phone or tablet. Plus, it includes 24/7 monitoring.\nCustomer: I like the sound of that. What kind of equipment do I need?\nAgent: We provide all the necessary equipment, including cameras and sensors.\nCustomer: And how long does installation take?\nAgent: Typically, installation takes about 2-3 hours, depending on the size of your home.\nCustomer: Okay, I think I'm interested. Can you give me a quote and schedule an installation?\nAgent: Absolutely. Let me just confirm a few details. Can you please confirm your address?\nCustomer: It's 123 Main Street.\nAgent: Great, thank you. I'm going to go ahead and email you a quote and schedule an installation for next Wednesday.\nCustomer: Sounds good. What time?\nAgent: How about 10 am?\nCustomer: That works for me. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll see you next Wednesday."
