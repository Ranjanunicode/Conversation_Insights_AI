I'm calling today to talk to you about our new smart thermostat.\nCustomer: Oh, I've been looking into getting a new thermostat. What makes yours so special?\nAgent: Our thermostat is Wi-Fi enabled, allowing you to control the temperature remotely from your phone or tablet.\nCustomer: That sounds convenient. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The thermostat itself is $249, but we're currently running a promotion that includes installation for just $99.\nCustomer: That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Do you have any financing options available?\nAgent: Yes, we offer a 0% interest financing plan for 12 months. Would you like me to explain the details?\nCustomer: Yes, please do.\nAgent: With our financing plan, you can purchase the thermostat and installation for just $20 per month for 12 months.\nCustomer: That sounds more manageable. What kind of warranty do you offer?\nAgent: Our thermostat comes with a 5-year warranty, and our installation work is guaranteed for 2 years.\nCustomer: Okay, I think I'm interested. Can you schedule an installation for this week?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) Yes, we have an opening on Thursday. Would that work for you?\nCustomer: Yes, that's perfect. What time?\nAgent: We can schedule it for 2 PM. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details.\nCustomer: Great, thank you. I'm looking forward to it.\nAgent: You're welcome.
