  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system offers real-time monitoring, motion detection, and seamless integration with your smartphone.\nCustomer: That sounds great. I've had issues with my current system's connectivity.\nAgent: I understand. Our system uses a cellular backup, ensuring you stay connected even during power outages.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a big plus. What's the cost?\nAgent: The starter package begins at $99, with a monthly monitoring fee of $29.99.\nCustomer: That's comparable to what I'm paying now. What about installation?\nAgent: We offer professional installation for a one-time fee of $199, or you can choose our DIY option.\nCustomer: I think I'd prefer the professional installation. Is there a contract?\nAgent: Yes, our standard contract is 36 months. However, we're currently running a promotion with no long-term commitment.\nCustomer: That's a great incentive. Can you email me more information and a quote?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send that over to you right away. Would you like to schedule an installation date as well?\nCustomer: Yes, please. How soon can someone come out?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) How about next Wednesday?\nCustomer: That works for me. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll get everything set up for you. I'll talk to you soon.\nCustomer: Sounds good. Bye.\nAgent: Bye."
