  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems, but I'm not sure what I need.\nAgent: Well, our system is a comprehensive solution that includes cameras, door sensors, and motion detectors. It's all controlled from a single app.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. What kind of cameras do you offer?\nAgent: We have both indoor and outdoor cameras with night vision and HD video.\nCustomer: Okay, that's good to know. What's the cost of the system?\nAgent: Our basic package starts at $99 per month, but we have a promotion going on right now that includes a free installation.\nCustomer: That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Do you have any other packages?\nAgent: Yes, we have a premium package that includes additional features like smart door locks and a dedicated monitoring service.\nCustomer: How much is the premium package?\nAgent: It's $149 per month, but it provides an extra layer of security and convenience.\nCustomer: I'm interested in the premium package. What's the process for installation?\nAgent: We'll send a technician to install the system at your convenience. It usually takes about 2-3 hours.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds good. Can I schedule the installation for next week?\nAgent: Let me check the schedule. (pause) Yes, we have an opening on Wednesday or Thursday.\nCustomer: Wednesday works for me. What time?\nAgent: How about 10 am?\nCustomer: That's perfect. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll send a confirmation email with all the details."
