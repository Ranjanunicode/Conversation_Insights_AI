We specialize in energy-efficient lighting systems.\nCustomer: Okay, I've heard of you. What can you do for me?\nAgent: We've developed a new line of LED bulbs that can help reduce your energy consumption by up to 50%.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. I've been looking to cut down on my electricity bill.\nAgent: Exactly. Our bulbs are not only energy-efficient but also last up to 5 times longer than traditional bulbs.\nCustomer: How much do they cost?\nAgent: We're currently offering a promotion where you can get a pack of 10 bulbs for $50.\nCustomer: That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Do you have any smaller packages?\nAgent: Yes, we have a starter kit with 5 bulbs for $25.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds more like what I'm looking for. What kind of warranty do you offer?\nAgent: Our bulbs come with a 5-year warranty, and we also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'll take the starter kit. How do I place an order?\nAgent: I can take your order right now over the phone. Would you like to pay with card or check?\nCustomer: I'll use my card. Can you please take my payment information?\nAgent: Of course, sir. I'll guide you through the process."
