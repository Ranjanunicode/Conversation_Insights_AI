We specialize in energy-efficient appliances.\nCustomer: Okay, I'm listening. What can you offer me?\nAgent: We have a new line of smart thermostats that can help reduce your energy bills by up to 30%.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. How does it work?\nAgent: Our thermostat learns your schedule and preferences to optimize your heating and cooling system.\nCustomer: I see. And how much does it cost?\nAgent: The thermostat itself is $250, but we're currently offering a discount of $50 for first-time customers.\nCustomer: That's still a bit pricey for me. Do you have any financing options?\nAgent: Yes, we do. We offer a 0% interest financing plan for 6 months.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds more manageable. What's the warranty on the product?\nAgent: We offer a 5-year warranty on all our thermostats.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you send me some more information?\nAgent: Absolutely, I can email you a brochure and a link to our website.\nCustomer: Great, thank you. I'll take a look and get back to you.\nAgent: Sounds good, Mr. Johnson. I'll follow up with you in a few days to answer any questions you may have.\nCustomer: Appreciate it, Emily. Have a good day.\nAgent: You too, Mr. Johnson. Bye for now."
