  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for answering. My name is John, and I'm calling from XYZ Corporation. How are you today?\nCustomer: I'm doing well, thanks. What's this about?\nAgent: We're a leading provider of energy-efficient solutions, and I'm calling to introduce our new smart thermostat.\nCustomer: Oh, I've been looking into those. What makes yours special?\nAgent: Our thermostat learns your schedule and preferences to optimize your heating and cooling system, saving you up to 30% on your energy bill.\nCustomer: That sounds impressive. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The thermostat itself is $249, but we're currently offering a promotion with a $50 rebate.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. What about installation costs?\nAgent: We offer professional installation for $100, or you can choose to install it yourself.\nCustomer: I think I'd rather have it installed professionally. So, the total would be $349?\nAgent: That's correct. And with the rebate, it would be $299.\nCustomer: Alright, I'm interested. Can you tell me more about the installation process?\nAgent: Absolutely. Our technicians will schedule a time that works for you and have it installed within an hour.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds good. How do I proceed with the purchase?\nAgent: I can take your order over the phone, or I can email you a link to complete the purchase online.\nCustomer: Just email me the link, please.\nAgent: Great, I'll send that over to you right away. Thank you for your business!"
