  "transcript": "Agent: Hi, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Oh, hi John. I did request some information about that. What can you tell me?\nAgent: Our system includes a state-of-the-art alarm, motion detectors, and video cameras that can be accessed remotely.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The basic package starts at $99 a month, but we have a promotion going on right now that includes a free installation, valued at $200.\nCustomer: That's a good deal. What kind of contract am I looking at?\nAgent: We offer a 3-year contract, but you can cancel at any time with a 30-day notice.\nCustomer: Okay, I like the flexibility. What about the equipment? Do I have to purchase that upfront?\nAgent: No, the equipment is included in the monthly fee, and we'll replace it for free if it ever becomes outdated or malfunctioning.\nCustomer: That's great. Can you tell me more about the video cameras?\nAgent: Our cameras have night vision, motion detection, and can be viewed remotely through our mobile app.\nCustomer: That sounds like what I'm looking for. Can you send me a quote and more information?\nAgent: Absolutely, I can email that to you right away. Would you like to schedule an installation appointment as well?\nCustomer: Yes, that would be great. What's the soonest you can send someone out?\nAgent: Let me check the schedule. (pause) How about next Wednesday?\nCustomer: That works for me. What time?\nAgent: We can do either 9am or 1pm. Which one is better for you?\nCustomer: 1pm is fine. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. I'll go ahead and send you that quote and confirm your installation appointment."
