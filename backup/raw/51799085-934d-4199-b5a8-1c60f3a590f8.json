Who is this again?\nAgent: My name is John, and I'm calling about our new line of smart home security systems.\nCustomer: Oh, okay. We've been thinking about upgrading our security system, actually.\nAgent: Great timing! Our system is top-of-the-line, with features like motion detection and live video feed.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. What makes it different from other systems on the market?\nAgent: Our system is completely wireless, making it easy to install and move around as needed.\nCustomer: That's a big plus for us, since we're planning on renovating soon.\nAgent: Exactly! And with our system, you can control everything from your smartphone or tablet.\nCustomer: How much does it cost?\nAgent: We have a few different packages available, starting at $99.99 per month.\nCustomer: That's a bit higher than I was expecting. What's included in that price?\nAgent: The $99.99 package includes the base system, one camera, and 24/7 monitoring.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Can you tell me more about the monitoring service?\nAgent: Absolutely. Our monitoring team is available 24/7 to respond to any alerts or issues.\nCustomer: Alright, I think we might be interested. Can you send me some more information?\nAgent: I'd be happy to. I can email you a brochure and follow up with a call next week.\nCustomer: Sounds good, thank you.\nAgent: You're welcome! I'll send that over to you right away.\nCustomer: Great, thanks again.\nAgent: Have a great day!"
