  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, yeah, I've been looking into security systems. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system offers 24/7 monitoring, motion detection, and smart alerts sent directly to your phone.\nCustomer: That sounds great. I've been having some issues with break-ins in my neighborhood.\nAgent: I understand your concern. Our system has a 99% success rate in preventing break-ins.\nCustomer: Wow, that's impressive. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The initial installation fee is $200, and then it's $30 per month for monitoring.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Do you have any promotions or discounts?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a promotion right now where you can get 10% off the installation fee.\nCustomer: That helps. What kind of equipment would I be getting?\nAgent: You'd receive a control panel, 3 door sensors, and 1 motion detector.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you come out to my house to give me a more detailed quote?\nAgent: Absolutely, I can schedule an appointment for our technician to come out and assess your home.\nCustomer: Great, how soon can they come out?\nAgent: We can schedule it for as early as tomorrow.\nCustomer: Tomorrow works for me. What time?\nAgent: How about 2 PM?\nCustomer: That's perfect. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll see you tomorrow at 2 PM."
