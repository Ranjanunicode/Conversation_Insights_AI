  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new energy-efficient water heater.\nCustomer: Oh, hi John. Yeah, I've been looking into replacing my old water heater.\nAgent: Great timing. Our product can save you up to 30% on your energy bills. May I ask, what's your current water heater's capacity?\nCustomer: It's a 50-gallon tank.\nAgent: Okay, our 50-gallon model would be a perfect replacement. It's also eco-friendly and has a longer lifespan.\nCustomer: That sounds good. What's the price point for that model?\nAgent: The 50-gallon model is $1,200, and we're currently offering a $200 rebate.\nCustomer: That's a bit higher than I was expecting. Do you have any financing options available?\nAgent: Yes, we do. We have a 0% interest financing plan for 12 months.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds doable. What's the installation process like?\nAgent: We have a team of certified technicians who will install the water heater for you. It usually takes about 2-3 hours.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you send me a quote and more information?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send you an email with all the details. Would you like to schedule an installation appointment as well?\nCustomer: Yes, please. How soon can it be done?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) How about next Wednesday?\nCustomer: That works for me.\nAgent: Great. I'll go ahead and schedule it. We'll also send you a confirmation email with all the details.\nCustomer: Sounds good. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. We appreciate your business, and we'll see you next Wednesday."
