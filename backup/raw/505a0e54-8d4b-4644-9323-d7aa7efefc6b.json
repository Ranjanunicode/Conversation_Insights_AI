My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system offers real-time monitoring, motion detection, and alerts sent directly to your phone.\nCustomer: That sounds great. I've had some issues with break-ins in my neighborhood.\nAgent: I understand your concern. Our system has a 99% success rate in preventing burglaries.\nCustomer: That's impressive. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The initial installation fee is $500, and then it's $30 per month for monitoring.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Do you have any discounts available?\nAgent: We're currently offering a 10% discount for new customers. I can also throw in a free camera.\nCustomer: That sounds like a good deal. What's the process for installation?\nAgent: We can schedule an installation at your convenience. It usually takes about 2 hours.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you email me the details?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send over a contract and some additional information.\nCustomer: Great, thank you. I'm looking forward to reviewing it.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll be in touch soon to follow up.\nCustomer: Sounds good. Thanks again, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. Have a great day!"
