What's this about?\nAgent: We specialize in energy-efficient lighting solutions for commercial properties. I came across your company and thought our product could be a good fit.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. We've been looking to reduce our energy costs.\nAgent: Exactly. Our LED lighting system can help you save up to 70% on your energy bills. It's also environmentally friendly and has a longer lifespan.\nCustomer: That's impressive. What kind of maintenance does it require?\nAgent: Very minimal. Our lights are designed to last up to 50,000 hours, and we offer a 5-year warranty.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds good. What's the cost of implementation?\nAgent: We offer a free consultation to assess your property and provide a customized quote. But on average, our clients see a return on investment within 2-3 years.\nCustomer: That's reasonable. Can you send me some more information?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll email you a brochure and case studies from similar companies. Would you like to schedule a consultation?\nCustomer: Yes, that would be great. What's your availability like?\nAgent: How about next Wednesday or Thursday?\nCustomer: Wednesday works for me. What time?\nAgent: How about 10 am?\nCustomer: That's perfect. I'll make sure to have our facilities manager available.\nAgent: Great, I'll send you a confirmation email. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to meeting you next Wednesday.\nCustomer: You're welcome. Talk to you then.\nAgent: Have a great day!"
