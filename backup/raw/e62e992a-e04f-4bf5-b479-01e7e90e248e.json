We specialize in energy-efficient products for homes and businesses.\nCustomer: Okay, what can you do for me?\nAgent: We've recently launched a new line of smart thermostats that can help you save up to 30% on your energy bills.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. I've been looking to reduce my energy costs.\nAgent: Great! Our smart thermostats are Wi-Fi enabled, allowing you to control the temperature remotely through our mobile app.\nCustomer: That's convenient. How much do they cost?\nAgent: Our starter package begins at $249, which includes the thermostat and installation.\nCustomer: That's a bit higher than I expected. Do you have any promotions or discounts available?\nAgent: Actually, we're running a summer special right now. If you purchase the starter package, we'll throw in a free smart plug, which is a $50 value.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds like a good deal. Can you tell me more about the smart plug?\nAgent: The smart plug allows you to control any appliance remotely and monitor its energy usage.\nCustomer: That's really cool. I think I'm interested in the starter package. Can you schedule an installation?\nAgent: Absolutely. Let me just check our schedule real quick. (pause) How about next Wednesday?\nCustomer: That works for me. What time?\nAgent: We can schedule the installation for 10 am. We'll send you a confirmation email with all the details.\nCustomer: Sounds good. Thank you, Emily.\nAgent: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. We'll see you next Wednesday."
