Who is this and what's this about?\nAgent: We specialize in providing energy-efficient solutions for homes and businesses. I'm calling today to talk to you about our new smart thermostat.\nCustomer: Oh, okay. I've been looking into getting a new thermostat actually.\nAgent: Great timing! Our smart thermostat can help you save up to 25% on your energy bills. It's also Wi-Fi enabled, so you can control it from your phone or tablet.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The thermostat itself is $249, but we're currently running a promotion where you can get it for $199.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit more than I was looking to spend. What kind of warranty do you offer?\nAgent: We offer a 5-year warranty on the thermostat, and our customer support team is available 24/7 to help with any issues.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you tell me more about the installation process?\nAgent: Absolutely. We offer professional installation, which typically takes about an hour. We also provide a free consultation to ensure it's installed correctly.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds good. Can I schedule an installation for next week?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) Yes, we have an opening on Wednesday or Thursday. Which day works best for you?\nCustomer: Wednesday is fine. What time?\nAgent: How about 2 PM?\nCustomer: That works. What's the next step?\nAgent: I'll go ahead and schedule the installation. We'll also send you a confirmation email with all the details.\nCustomer: Sounds good. Thanks for your help, John.\nAgent: You're welcome! We'll see you on Wednesday."
