And how much does it cost?\nAgent: The EcoSave system starts at $999, but we're currently offering a promotion that includes a free installation and a 10-year warranty.\nCustomer: That's a bit pricey. Do you have any financing options available?\nAgent: Yes, we offer financing options with 0% interest for 12 months. Would you like me to explain the details?\nCustomer: Yes, please do.\nAgent: With our financing option, you can pay as low as $83 per month for 12 months, and then own the system outright.\nCustomer: That sounds more manageable.
