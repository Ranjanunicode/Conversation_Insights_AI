  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems, but I'm not sure what I need.\nAgent: Well, our system includes cameras, door sensors, and a central hub that can be controlled from your phone.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. How much does it cost?\nAgent: The starter package is $99, and then there's a monthly subscription fee of $29.99.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. What makes it worth the extra cost?\nAgent: Our system is highly customizable and integrates with other smart devices in your home. Plus, it includes 24/7 monitoring.\nCustomer: I like the sound of that. Can you tell me more about the monitoring service?\nAgent: Yes, our team is available around the clock to respond to any alerts or issues with your system.\nCustomer: That's reassuring. Do you offer any discounts for long-term contracts?\nAgent: Yes, if you sign up for a 2-year contract, we can offer a 10% discount on the monthly fee.\nCustomer: Okay, I think I'm interested. Can you email me some more information?\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll send you a follow-up email with all the details. Would you like to schedule an installation appointment?\nCustomer: Yes, please. How soon can someone come out?\nAgent: Let me check the schedule. (pause) How about next Wednesday?\nCustomer: That works for me. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. I'll send over the email and we'll get everything set up for next Wednesday."
