  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into those systems. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system offers real-time monitoring, motion detection, and alerts sent directly to your phone.\nCustomer: That sounds great. I've had issues with my current system not alerting me quickly enough.\nAgent: Exactly. Our system is designed to provide instant notifications, giving you peace of mind whether you're at home or away.\nCustomer: How does the installation process work?\nAgent: We offer professional installation, which typically takes about 2-3 hours, depending on the size of your home.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds reasonable. What's the cost of the system and installation?\nAgent: The system itself starts at $999, and installation is $200. However, we're currently running a promotion that includes free installation.\nCustomer: That's a great deal. What kind of support do you offer if I have issues with the system?\nAgent: We have a 24/7 support team available to assist with any questions or concerns you may have.\nCustomer: Alright, I'm interested. Can you email me a quote and more information about the promotion?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send that over to you right away. Would you like to schedule an installation appointment as well?\nCustomer: Yes, please. How soon can someone come out?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) How about next Wednesday?\nCustomer: That works for me. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome. We'll get that all set up for you."
