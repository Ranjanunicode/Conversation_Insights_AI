  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for answering. My name is John, and I'm calling from XYZ Corporation. How are you today?\nCustomer: I'm doing well, thanks. Who is this again?\nAgent: My name is John, and I'm calling about our new energy-efficient water heater, the EcoHeat.\nCustomer: Oh, I've heard of it. What makes it so special?\nAgent: The EcoHeat uses advanced technology to reduce energy consumption by up to 30% while providing the same level of performance as traditional water heaters.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. I've been looking to replace my old water heater soon.\nAgent: Great timing! We're currently offering a promotion that includes a free installation and a 10-year warranty.\nCustomer: That sounds like a good deal. How much does the EcoHeat cost?\nAgent: The price starts at $1,200, but with the promotion, you'll get a $200 discount.\nCustomer: Okay, that's still a bit pricey for me. Do you have any financing options available?\nAgent: Yes, we offer financing plans with monthly payments as low as $50.\nCustomer: That's more manageable. Can you tell me more about the installation process?\nAgent: Our team of professionals will handle the installation, and it usually takes about 2-3 hours.\nCustomer: Alright, I think I'm interested. Can you send me some more information and a formal quote?\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll send you an email with all the details. Would you like me to follow up with a call next week to answer any further questions?\nCustomer: Yes, that would be great. Thank you, John.\nAgent: You're welcome, and I look forward to speaking with you next week. Have a great day!"
