Who is this and how did you get my number?\nAgent: We got your number from a trade show you attended last month. I'm calling to follow up on our new product, the EcoClean 5000.\nCustomer: Oh, I remember seeing that at the show. It's a cleaning system, right?\nAgent: That's correct. The EcoClean 5000 is a state-of-the-art cleaning system designed for commercial use.\nCustomer: We're actually in the market for a new cleaning system. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system uses advanced nanotechnology to break down dirt and grime, making it more efficient and eco-friendly.\nCustomer: That sounds interesting. What kind of cost savings can we expect?\nAgent: Our system can help reduce water and chemical usage by up to 30%, which can lead to significant cost savings.\nCustomer: Okay, that's a good point. What's the pricing for the system?\nAgent: The pricing starts at $10,000, but we're currently running a promotion for $9,500.\nCustomer: That's a bit higher than we were hoping to spend. Do you offer any financing options?\nAgent: Yes, we do offer financing options. We can discuss those with you if you're interested.\nCustomer: Okay, sure. Can you send me some more information and we can discuss further?\nAgent: Absolutely. I'll send you an email with all the details. Is there a good time for me to follow up with you next week?\nCustomer: Yeah, next Wednesday would be fine.\nAgent: Great, I'll make a note of that. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to speaking with you next week.\nCustomer: You're welcome, thanks for calling."
