  "transcript": "Agent: Hello, thank you for considering our company. My name is John, and I'm calling about our new smart home security system.\nCustomer: Hi John, I've been looking into security systems. What makes yours stand out?\nAgent: Our system offers real-time monitoring, motion detection, and alerts sent directly to your phone.\nCustomer: That sounds great. I've been having some issues with break-ins in my neighborhood.\nAgent: I understand your concern. Our system has a 99% success rate in preventing burglaries.\nCustomer: That's impressive. What's the cost of the system and installation?\nAgent: The system itself is $999, and installation is $200. However, we're running a promotion right now, and you can get 10% off.\nCustomer: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Do you offer any monthly monitoring fees?\nAgent: Yes, our monitoring fee is $29.99 per month, but it's waived for the first three months.\nCustomer: Alright, I'm interested. Can you come out to my house to install it this week?\nAgent: Let me check our schedule. (pause) Yes, we have an opening on Thursday or Friday.\nCustomer: Thursday works for me. What time?\nAgent: How about 2 PM?\nCustomer: That's perfect. I'll see you then.\nAgent: Great, we'll send you a confirmation email with all the details. Thank you for choosing our company.\nCustomer: Thank you, John. I'm looking forward to it.\nAgent: You're welcome. Have a great day!\nCustomer: You too, bye.\nAgent: Bye."
